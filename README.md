ReactOS is a free, open-source operating system designed to be compatible with Microsoft Windows applications and drivers. Built from scratch (not based on Linux), it follows the architecture of Windows NT and aims to provide a lightweight alternative for running legacy Windows software.

The system is mainly written in C and uses components like a custom kernel, HAL, Win32 subsystem, and its own bootloader. It integrates parts of the Wine project for application compatibility.

Key features include a Windows-like interface, real hardware driver support, and a built-in application manager. Although still in development (alpha stage), ReactOS is ideal for developers interested in operating systems and those needing an open alternative to older versions of Windows.

Common issues involve boot errors, driver problems, or app crashes, often fixed through debugging or manual driver setup. Contributors are encouraged to follow clean-room practices and help improve documentation and stability.
